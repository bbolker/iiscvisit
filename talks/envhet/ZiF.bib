	abstract = {The effect of patch demography on the structure of forest tree communities was examined using a patch-age and tree-size structured model of forest dynamics. Changes in abundance of species of different types (four different maximum tree-size classes each in two or three shade-tolerance classes) were numerically modeled in response to changes in the duration of the gap-formation-free lag phase. Average patch mortality was identical in all simulations. Tolerant species were more abundant without a lag phase due to larger variation in patch longevity, while subtolerant or intolerant species were successful when patch longevity was fixed with a long duration of lag phase. Variation in patch-age distribution facilitated species coexistence. Increasing ‘advance regeneration’, or surviving fraction at gap formation, brought about the exclusive dominance of the tolerant species. Results suggest that patch demography plays a significant role in the community organization of forest trees. In species-rich systems like tropical rain forests, longevity or canopy duration of large trees can differ among species, which brings about the variation in patch longevity, thus promoting further coexistence of species.},

	abstract = {* {1It} is an essential feature of plants that leaves at higher levels have better access to light than those at lower levels. Thus, larger plants generally enjoy greater success in competing for light than smaller ones. We analyse the effect of such size-asymmetry, or one-sided competition, on the successful coexistence of plant species, using an analytically tractable model for stratified populations, in which a plant in the same layer exhibits the same crowding effect as any other, irrespective of species. * {2A} two-layer population that is reproductive in upper layer and juvenile in lower layer has a uniquely stable (plant-size-weighted) equilibrium density, as long as its fecundity is sufficient to compensate for its mortality rate. We also calculate a unique threshold lower-layer density of this layered population when there is no upper-layer plant. This threshold lower-layer density is larger than the weighted equilibrium density with upper layer, except for the case of perfect two-sided competition. * {3A} two-layer species can stably coexist with a one-layer, understorey species as a result of one-sided, but not two-sided competition. The coexistence condition is that the equilibrium density of the one-layer species lies between the threshold lower-layer density and the equilibrium density of the two-layer species. For an understorey species to coexist successfully with a two-layer species, any advantage in demographic performance, most prominently in a sufficiently high fecundity per plant must offset the disadvantage of living in dark conditions. * {4Results} from a model of multi-layer populations suggest that several species differing in terms of maximum layer and fecundity can coexist under conditions of one-sided competition. We demonstrate an example of the stable coexistence of eight species. The inter-specific trade-offs predicted by the model correspond to patterns observed in a rain forest. * {5Synthesis.} We propose a stratification theory that explains the generation and maintenance of the successful coexistence of plant species. Under the condition of one-sided competition, a canopy population that takes advantage of escaping from understorey competition shows an ability to invade an understorey with a density higher than its own equilibrium density, and which offers opportunities for an understorey population with high fecundity and/or shade tolerance to coexist. The predicted coexistence of species that share maximum canopy height is most pronounced for trees of tropical rain forests.},

	abstract = {1. The forest architecture hypothesis of tree species coexistence proposed here was developed from a general model of size-structured tree populations in gap-dynamic rain forest. The model consists of a submodel describing the dynamics of the age distribution of local stands, which reflects gap-dynamic processes in a whole forest, and another describing the change in size distribution of trees in stands of each age. The model expresses the dynamics of both species-averaged systems and multi-species systems. 2. In the model, the intensity of suppression of tree size growth, survival and seedling recruitment is a function of local crowding. Crowding is measured in each stand in terms of the cumulative basal area of trees of all species that are larger than the subject individual, while the potential rate of seedling recruitment is proportional to the basal area of mother trees in a whole forest. Tree mortality results either from thinning due to local crowding or from gap formation. Trees surviving gap formation contribute to regeneration in a newborn gap. 3. Simulation was carried out using permanent plot data from a warm-temperate rain forest. The simulation for a whole tree population converged to a unique equilibrium state with a stationary stand age distribution and a stationary size distribution in each stand. Simulated size distributions matched observed distributions in gaps and closed stands. 4. The dynamics of a multi-species system composed of representative canopy, subcanopy and understorey species (all non-pioneer but with different tolerance levels) was also simulated. Results showed convergence to a stable equilibrium coexistence within a limited range of species parameters. Although stable coexistence also resulted from the model without stand mosaic by means of the trade-off between potential maximum size and potential recruitment rate, inclusion of gap dynamics in the model widened the range of coexistence in this trade-off space and reduced the time for convergence to equilibrium. Gap dynamics provided further possibilities for coexistence by various trade-offs, e.g. between potential size growth rate and susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate. Results suggested the importance of vertical and horizontal structure of forest in maintaining tree species diversity.},

	abstract = {Modern animal movement modelling derives from two traditions. Lagrangian models, based on random walk behaviour, are useful for multi-step trajectories of single animals. Continuous Eulerian models describe expected behaviour, averaged over stochastic realizations, and are usefully applied to ensembles of individuals. We illustrate three modern research arenas. (i) Models of home-range formation describe the process of an animal ‘settling down’, accomplished by including one or more focal points that attract the animal's movements. (ii) Memory-based models are used to predict how accumulated experience translates into biased movement choices, employing reinforced random walk behaviour, with previous visitation increasing or decreasing the probability of repetition. (iii) Lévy movement involves a step-length distribution that is over-dispersed, relative to standard probability distributions, and adaptive in exploring new environments or searching for rare targets. Each of these modelling arenas implies more detail in the movement pattern than general models of movement can accommodate, but realistic empiric evaluation of their predictions requires dense locational data, both in time and space, only available with modern {GPS} telemetry.},

Estimated vector fields of movement were mapped onto the project area at selected times of the day to examine spatial patterns of movement in relation to topography. Using the concept of a potential function, we were able to study the influence of roads and grassland foraging areas on elk movements. Doing so we identified broad spatial patterns of elk movements and showed the time dependent effects of habitat features within the habitat mosaic at Starkey. Our analyses quantify the cycles of movements in spring and summer in terms of attraction or repulsion to specific habitat features, and illustrate the magnitude, timing and direction of these movements.

	abstract = {Mechanisms contributing to species coexistence have at least one of two modes of action: (i) stabilization of populations through restoring forces and (ii) equalization of fitness across individuals of different species. Recently, ecologists have begun gleaning the relative roles of these by testing the predictions of neutral theory, which predicts the properties of communities under pure fitness equalization. This null hypothesis was rejected for forests of southern Ontario based on large-scale (similar to 100 km) spatial synchrony evident in the fossil pollen record over the entire Holocene, and the argument that a species' relative abundance would instead vary independently at such distances in the absence of stabilizing mechanisms. This test of neutral theory was criticized based on the idea that the synchrony might be produced by dispersal alone. Here, I revisit this test of neutral theory by explicitly calculating the synchrony expected in these forests using a novel simulation method enabling examination of the distribution of a species over large spatial and temporal scales.   A novel neutral simulation algorithm tracking only the focal species was used to calculate the neutral expectation for spatial synchrony properties examined empirically by Clark and {MacLachlan} [(2003) Stability of forest biodiversity. Nature 423:635-8] using fossil pollen data from eight lake sites. The coefficient of variation {(CV)} in a species' relative abundance across the eight sites (initiated at about 10\% with a small {CV)} was calculated for 10 runs over a 10 000 year time interval. The {CV} reflects the level of spatial synchrony in that less synchronous dynamics should lead to more variation across space (a higher equilibrium {CV)}, and in particular, a greater increase in the {CV} over time from a small initial value. A 'two dimensional t' fat-tailed dispersal kernel was assumed with parameters set to the median derived from seed trap data for deciduous wind-dispersed trees. Robustness of results to assumed dispersal distance, density of trees on the landscape, site sizes, age at maturity and starting spatial distribution were checked.   In contrast to the prediction of Clark and {MacLachlan} that, in the absence of stabilization, the {CV} across the sites should increase over time from levels observed at the beginning of the Holocene, under fat-tailed dispersal my neutral model robustly predicted only a brief (50 years) and small increase in the {CV.} I conclude that purely fitness-equalized species coexistence cannot be rejected based on the observed lack of increase in the {CV} across the eight sites in southern Ontario over the Holocene. Synchronous variation in environmental factors could alternatively explain the observed synchrony without the need for stabilization. However, neither dispersal nor environmental synchrony seems likely explanations for the quick widespread recovery of Tsuga in the Holocene after its seeming decimation, likely due to a pest outbreak.},

I present the results of a two‐species competition scenario. Coexistence is found to be possible for competitively dissimilar species, and the criterion for this coexistence is given analytically in the reaction‐diffusion approximation. A higher frequency of tree falls implies a smaller extinction probability of least adapted species. The multispecies model is also investigated. A mathematical quantity—the persistence function—permits measurement of the ability of a species to out compete other species locally. This quantity is compared with the average time to extinction, and it is computed for the {TROLL} simulator. I interpret the shape of this function in light of available information on the persistence function in simple interacting particle systems. These results indicate an analogy between the dynamics of forest communities and a simple discrete and spatially explicit model, the voter model. The ecological implications of this analogy are discussed and are extended to species‐rich communities.},

Attempts to infer underlying ecological process from observed patterns in ecology have been widespread, but have generally relied on first-order (non-spatial) community characteristics such as the species abundance distribution {(SAD).} This measure has become an important test of several theories of species coexistence, but has proved unsuccessful in distinguishing between them.   2. Spatially explicit data are increasingly available for a range of ecological communities, and analysis methods for these data are well developed. However, relatively little work has investigated the potential of these data for similar inference about mechanisms of coexistence.   3. In this study, we systematically investigate the spatial and non-spatial signals of simulated ecological processes. We include neutral, niche, lottery, {Janzen-Connell} and heteromyopia models, deriving and comparing first-and second-order measures for the patterns they generate.   4. We find that the {SAD} is unable to distinguish reliably between underlying models, with random variation in its shape concealing any systematic differences.   5. A new second-order summary measure of spatial structure derived in this paper, in contrast, proves highly sensitive to the type of ecological interaction being modelled, and is robust to random variation.   6. Synthesis. A simple summary measure of the spatial structure of plant communities is presented and found to be a more powerful indicator of underlying process in simulated data than a widely used first-order measure, the {SAD.} The potential for answering important ecological questions using spatial statistics, particularly concerning mechanisms of coexistence in diverse communities, appears to be great.},

By calculating the probability of joint occupancy of two locations at a distance x, it is shown that a haploid model embodying the latter two assumptions violates the first, forming larger and larger clumps of individuals separated by greater and greater distances. Thus the model is biologically irrelevant, even though it is possible to use it to calculate probabilities of genetic identity at different distances. The formation of these clumps is verified by computer simulation. The same phenomenon occurs in two- and three-dimensional models. In models of finite regions (a circle or a torus), the formation of clumps takes the form of the certainty of ultimate local extinction of the organism in each region. This does not occur if we hold the number of individuals on the circle or torus constant, but considerable departure from random distribution still results. The stepping-stone models appear for the present to be the only well-defined models of geographically structured populations with finite population density.},

	abstract = {Many seemingly plausible mathematical models of small-scale ecological interactions predict the self-organisation of dynamic, coherent and large scale spatial patterns (e.g. spirals). If true, such patterns would have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. For the most part, however, empirical studies have not corroborated their existence, suggesting erroneous dynamics in the models, shortcomings in empirical methodology, or both. Arguments for categorically dismissing self-organized patterns have been based on their assumed sensitivity to symmetry-breaking stochastic noise. However, many plausible mechanisms for generating patterns are robust to noise, and consequently broken symmetry is insufficient grounds for dismissing these self-organized patterns.},

	abstract = {It is generally well understood that some ecological factors select for increased and others for decreased dispersal. However, it has remained difficult to assess how the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the spatio-temporal structure of the environment. We address this question with an individual-based model that enables habitat structure to be controlled through variables such as patch size, patch turnover rate, and patch quality. Increasing patch size at the expense of patch density can select for more or less dispersal, depending on the initial configuration. In landscapes consisting of high-quality and long-lived habitat patches, patch degradation selects for increased dispersal, yet patch loss may select for reduced dispersal. These trends do not depend on the component of life-history that is affected by habitat quality or the component of life-history through which density-dependence operates. Our results are based on a mathematical method that enables derivation of both the evolutionary stable strategy and the stationary genotype distribution that evolves in a polymorphic population. The two approaches generally lead to similar predictions. However, the evolutionary stable strategy assumes that the ecological and evolutionary time scales can be separated, and we find that violation of this assumption can critically alter the evolutionary outcome.},

	abstract = {Natural selection is an immense and important subject, yet there have been few attempts to summarize its effects on natural populations, and fewer still which discuss the problems of working with natural selection in the wild. These are the purposes of John Endler's book. In it, he discusses the methods and problems involved in the demonstration and measurement of natural selection, presents the critical evidence for its existence, and places it in an evolutionary perspective.          Professor Endler finds that there are a remarkable number of direct demonstrations of selection in a wide variety of animals and plants. The distribution of observed magnitudes of selection in natural populations is surprisingly broad, and it overlaps extensively the range of values found in artificial selection. He argues that the common assumption that selection is usually weak in natural populations is no longer tenable, but that natural selection is only one component of the process of evolution; natural selection can explain the change of frequencies of variants, but not their origins.},
